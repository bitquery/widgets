Blockchain Visualization Widgets
============

Library of visual components to build data visualization interface to the blockchain data.
Universal tool across all major blockchains ( ethereum, tron, bitcoin, zcash, many more...).

TLDR; Try [https://explorer.bitquery.io](https://explorer.bitquery.io) which is 
[open sourced](https://github.com/bitquery/explorer) and completely built using widgets.
Javascript programmers may start with [JSFiddle examples](https://github.com/bitquery/widgets/wiki/JSFiddle).

Every widget is a reusable visualization component to display the data from blockchain.
Typically every widget is displaying a result set from GraphQL request.

## Usage

To start with, look our [wiki](https://github.com/bitquery/widgets/wiki). You do not need programming skills
to use and embed widgets, most tasks can be done by examples. To use specialized filtering and data querying
you will need basic understanding of [GraphQL language](https://graphql.org/).

## Setup

Clone this repo to your desktop and run 

`npm install` 

to install all the dependencies.
